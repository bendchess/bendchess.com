## Club Nights (MeetUp)
We meet weekly but the night and the venue changes depending on the time of
year. We organize this via [the MeetUp][meetup].

Normally, in the Summer we meet on Thursday evenings and Wednesday evenings in
the winter. (Days are subject to change depending on what our hosts prefer!)
See the latest [MeetUp events][events] to check current venue and times.

Note that if we cancel a club-night you will only get notified if you have
RSVP'd [via MeetUp][meetup]!

### What to expect
Bring a board &amp; a clock (if you have ones you prefer) or use the equipment
provided by the club. Look for others, introduce yourself and challenge someone
to a game! It's a no-pressure, unrated, relaxed meetup where you can sit down
and play anyone. Food & drink is usually accessible either through local vendors
or the venue itself.

Really, just check out [the MeetUp][meetup]!
