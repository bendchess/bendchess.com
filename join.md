**We strongly advise joining both the MeetUp and Mailing List.**

## Club Nights (MeetUp)
We use MeetUp to organize club-nights where members meet to play.
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/bend-chess-go-club/">Join the MeetUp</a> to get
notified of up-comming club-nights, changes of venue or cancellations.

Bring a board &amp; a clock (if you have ones you prefer) or use the equipment
provided by the club. Look for others, introduce yourself and challenge someone
to a game! It's a no-pressure, unrated, relaxed meetup where you can sit down
and play anyone.

Join us at our next Club Night! See <a href="https://www.meetup.com/bend-chess-go-club/events/">
The MeetUp Events Page</a> for the next event!


## Mailing List
The mailing list allows to to announce changes to the club's structure or to
announce news to the community. We recommend that all members
