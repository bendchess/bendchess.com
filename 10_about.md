## The Club
<img class="page-context-right" title="Chess players compete in the 2022 Spring Swiss Tournament." src="/assets/images/photos/2022-06-the-collective.jpg">
We are an informal club that meets to play Chess & Go. We meet one evening per
week at a fun, lively (and seasonal) venue with access to food & drink. We try
to cultivate a light-hearted atmosphere and a welcoming scene for beginners &amp;
experts alike.

Enquiries: <a href="mailto:bendchess@gmail.com">bendchess@gmail.com</a>


## The Venues
The Bend Chess &amp; Go Club exists because of the generosity of our hosts:

*   **Venue: [Crux Fermentation Project][crux]**, Wednesdays 6pm.
*   <a href="https://www.thecommonsbend.com/">The Commons Cafe &amp; Taproom</a>
    may host special events over the Summer.

## Staff
We have organizers, captains & deputies. We work together to promote the success
of the club.


### Officers
The club has organizers who manage the club day-to-day. We have two Club Captains,
one for Chess and one for Go - the Captains drive engagement for each game at the
club.

### Deputies
Supporting the Captains are the Club Deputies. A Deputy embodies the culture
of the club and have often helped new members and beginners get started, or they
fill-in for the Captains when they're absent.
