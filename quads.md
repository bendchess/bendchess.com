## Pairings
See the [Google Doc for pairings][googledoc]. To sign-up for Quads speak to Dean at club-night.

## What are Quads?
Some of our members (but not all) participate in our monthly Quads competition.
Each Quad is a Chess tournament, where groups of four players (a quad) compete in an
all-play-all event. **Games are played gradually over the course of the month.**
Unplayed games are scored as nil and inactive players are removed from the next
month's pairings.

Quads are rank-ordered and the top Quad is called the Championship. The winner
of each Quad will get promoted to the Quad above. The last-place finisher will
get demoted to the Quad below. As players join/leave the Quads extra promotions
and demotions may happen to rebalance the Quads.

As well as competing in the Quads, there are two other competitions. Each year
the winners of the Championship Quad compete to become Club Chess Champion.
Each game and every point scored also contribute towards a Grand Prix score.
Each Grand Prix lasts three months and allows active players to compete across
Quads.

## Quad-Night Points
**The first club-night of every month is Quad-Night.** Quad games played on a
Quad-Night score extra points that count towards tie-breaks and the Grand Prix
title. While the result matters for the Quad tournament it makes no difference
to the extra Quad-Night points. One point is awarded for each Quad game played
on Quad-Night.


## Tie-Breaks
When two players score the same points tie-breaks are used to decide which
player is promoted/demoted. The following tie-breaks are used in order:

1.  Head-to-head score.
2.  Quad-night points.
3.  Grand-prix points.
4.  Lowest-rating wins.

## Grand-Prix
Each quarter Quad players compete in the Grand-Prix. At the end of the Quarter,
the player to accumulate the most Grand-Prix points over 3 months wins. (The
same tie-breaks as Quads apply.)

Grand-Prix points for each month are calculated as:

>   score + games played + quad night points

There are four Grand-Prix races each year:

|Grand-Prix|Months|
|Winter|January-March|
|Spring|April-June|
|Summer|July-September|
|Fall|October-November|

For the Fall Grand-Prix, points for the entire year are counted - so it becomes
a Grand-Prix-of-the-Year competition.

## Championship
Winning the Championship Quad scores points towards the Club Chess
Championship. At the end of each year, the winner of the most points is named
Club Chess Champion.

The number of points changes each month, with months later in the year scoring
more highly:

|Month|Points|
|---|---|
|January-June|1|
|July-September|1.5|
|October-November|2|
|December|Not played|
