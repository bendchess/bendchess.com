1.  [Join the MeetUp][meetup] so that you can RSVP to club-nights.
2.  Attend a club-night and play some games!
3.  Once at the club, join our Discord (details at venue) to keep up-to date!


## Club Nights (MeetUp)
We meet weekly but the night and the venue changes depending on the time of
year. We organize this via [the MeetUp][meetup].

Note that if we cancel a club-night you will only get notified if you have
RSVP'd [via MeetUp][meetup]!

### What to expect
Boards, pieces &amp; clocks are provided! Look for others, introduce yourself
and challenge someone to a game! It's a no-pressure, unrated, relaxed meetup
where you can sit down and play anyone. Food & drink is usually accessible
either through local vendors or the venue itself.

Really, just check out [the MeetUp][meetup]!


## Quads
Please speak to Dean about joining [Quads](/quads/). There is a sign-up sheet
available for members on club-nights. (Note that we recommend that only active
members sign-up for Quads.)
