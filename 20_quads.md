## Pairings, Results & Rules
See the [Google Doc][googledoc].

## What are Quads?
Some of our members (but not all) participate in our monthly Quads competition.
Each Quad is a tournament, where groups of four players (a quad) compete in an
all-play-all event. **Games are played gradually over the course of the month.**
Unplayed games are scored as nil and inactive players are removed from the next
month's pairings.

Go Quads &amp; Chess Quads work slightly differently.

### Chess Quads &amp; Chess Championship
Quads are rank-ordered and the top Quad is called the Championship. The winner
of each Quad will get promoted to the Quad above. The last-place finisher will
get demoted to the Quad below. As players join/leave the Quads extra promotions
and demotions may happen to rebalance the Quads.

Quad winners score points towards the Club Chess Championship according to which
Quad is won and where they place:

|Quad|Position|Points|
|---|---|---|
|Championship|1st|5|
| |2nd|3|
| |3rd|2|
|Challenger|1st|3|
| |2nd|2|
| |3rd|1|
|Any other Quad|1st|2|
| |2nd|1|


### Go Quads
Quads are rank-ordered and grouped according to strength, with the goal of
keeping opponent's within 9 stones of each other. All games are played with a
handicap to make the games even. If you rank-up, you will be promoted to a more
suitable Quad. Go Quads have fewer participants than Chess Quads, so we're kind
of free-wheeling it. For now, Go Quads last 3-months, with 3 games to be played
versus each opponent in that time.

Quad winners score points towards the Club Go Championship according to the
strength of the Quad they won:

|Quad|Position|Points|
|---|---|---|
|1 Dan+|1st|5|
| |2nd|3|
| |3rd|2|
|1 Dan - 9 Kyu|1st|3|
| |2nd|2|
| |3rd|1|
|10 Kyu - 19 Kyu|1st|2|
| |2nd|1|


## Sign-Up/Opt-Out
Please speak to Dean at club-night if you'd like to sign-up or opt-out. There
is a sign-up (and an opt-out) form on the clip-board which should be filled in.

If you become inactive you will be dropped. If you know you'll be away - let
Dean know in advance and he can adjust pairings. You can rejoin at any time.
Just speak to Dean - in some cases we can get you onto the super-quad right away.

> We only recommend Quads to members who average at least 50% attendance.


## Prizes
Quad winners receive Championship points towards the Club Championship Trophy.
The Grand-Prix winners mug is awarded every three months to the Grand-Prix
winner!


## Tie-Breaks
When two players score the same points tie-breaks are used to decide which
player is promoted/demoted. The following tie-breaks are used in order:

1.  Head-to-head score.
2.  Games played.
3.  Nights attended.
4.  Previous Grand-prix.
5.  Championship points.
6.  Rating.


## Grand-Prix
Each quarter Quad players compete in the Grand-Prix. At the end of the Quarter,
the player to accumulate the most Grand-Prix points over 3 months wins. (The
same tie-breaks as Quads apply.)

**The winner of each Grand-Prix wins the Grand-Prix Mug!** Further, it is common
for players to to tie a Quad with e.g. 4/6 having attended each week. In such cases,
the previous Grand-Prix becomes an important tie-break, and Quad players should
know if they are paired with a grand-prix winner (and that they will lose the tie-break!)

Grand-Prix points for each month are calculated as:

>   score + games played + nights attended

The Grand-Prix serves as a function of engagement+performance. There are four
Grand-Prix races each year:

|Grand-Prix|Months|
|---|---|
|Winter|January-March|
|Spring|April-June|
|Summer|July-September|
|Holiday|October-December|
