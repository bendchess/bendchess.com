> Daniel B, Dean C &amp; Max S reveive their prizes.

Congratulations to Dean C for winning the **2023 Chess Champion** Trophy. A
tight race between Dean C &amp; Daniel B has been going on all year, and the
Championship wasn't decided until the last Quad games of the year this
December! Daniel & Dean were tied on 42 points going into the last round, but
by the time they played their games Daniel needed to win both to get through.

It was a brilliant race, but 2024 already looks like a different story, with
Zach C &amp; Andrew M well established to compete for the title.

Daniel B didn't go home empty-handed, though - his performance throughout the
year was consistent enough to win the 2023 Grand-Prix Mug. He has quite a
collection of mugs already! Max S narrowly missed out, scoring 98.5 points next
to Daniel's 100 for the year. Better luck next-time Max!

Max S's performance made one choice very clear, and I'm sure the club will
agree that he deserves the title of **2023 Junior of the Year**. Max was
presented with the famous Polgar Chess manual for his efforts!
